## System identification of electro-mechanical positioning system

EMPS is a system identification benchmark problem, found at [http://nonlinearbenchmark.org/](http://nonlinearbenchmark.org/).

We are inferring parameters of the dynamics from paired input-output data, using variational free energy minimization.
